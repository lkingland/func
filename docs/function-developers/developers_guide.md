# Function Developer's Guide
Here you will find links to getting started guides, reference documents and other information important to know as a Knative Function developer.

## Prerequisites and Installation
Before learning to develop Functions, you should have the client [installed](../installing_cli.md) and a configured [Kubernetes cluster](../getting_started_kubernetes.md) with Knative installed.

## Getting Started: a Step by Step Tutorial

To learn how to work with functions quickly, have a look at the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) tutorial. This document will guide you through a quick review of prerequisites, and show you how to create, build and deploy your first Function project.

## CLI Command Reference

For detailed documentation on the CLI and its commands, please see the [Command reference](../reference/commands.txt).

## Function Project Configuration

For a detailed description of the `func.yaml` file that is used for the Function project configuration, please see the [`func.yaml` reference](../reference/func_yaml.md).

## Building Functions on Cluster

For a detailed description of how to build a Function on a cluster with Tekton Pipelines, please see the [On Cluster Build Guide](../reference/on_cluster_build.md).

## Language Guides

Each of the language runtimes included in the built-in Function templates has its own reference guide.
